### 🎬 Back in Action

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🧨🚗🏠📂🚤

- **Watch Date:** January 25

- **Release Date:** January 17

- **Genre:** Action Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** PG-13

- **Duration:** 114 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Netflix

- **IMDB Description:** Former CIA spies Emily and Matt are pulled back into espionage after their secret identities are exposed. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21191806/?ref_=fn_t_1)


  **My Thoughts:** This movie is action-packed and fun. Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz are hilarious in it, and it has a good storyline. It has some good one-liners, and the action is somewhat believable. The filming locations are unique, and it was a more modern take on the classic spy parents and unknowing kids storyline.

  **Letterboxd Review:** Modern lingo + spies

  **IMDB Rating:** 5.9/10

  **My Rating:** 4 ⭐

    It is a spy movie perfect for a family with older kids. 


### 🎬 The Accountant 2

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 📸🔫💻🚙🏍️

- **Watch Date:** May 21

- **Release Date:** April 25

- **Genre:** Action Thriller

- **MPA Rating:** R

- **Duration:** 132 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Prime Video

- **IMDB Description:** Christian Wolff applies his brilliant mind and illegal methods to reconstruct the unsolved puzzle of a Treasury chief's murder. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7068946/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520acco)

  **My Thoughts:** I am a little biased as The Accountant is one of my favorite movies. This movie does an excellent job at continuing to build the characters explored in the first film. This movie takes place when Marybeth Medina *(Cynthia Addai-Robinson)* calls upon Christian Wolff *(Ben Affleck)* to help find who killed Ray King *(J.K. Simmons)* which was Wolff's chosen government contact.

	The movie brings back Braxton *(Jon Bernthal)*, Wolff's brother, and the chemistry between them is great. Braxton brings a lot of quick comedic one-liners that definitely lightened the movie. I thought the storyline was also really cool. The twist of who the killer of Ray was was done in a great way. The movie stayed entertaining and built upon the characters. It is also cool to see Medina work with Wolff and Braxton.

  **Letterboxd Review:** Braxton is a mood for sure

  **IMDB Rating:** 6.6/10
 
  **My Rating:** 4.5 ⭐

   I recommend seeing the first movie before if you haven't already.

  **My Thoughts:** I liked the concept, and it is a good laugh. Ke Huy Quan is great. I did find it a little over the top, and I don't see myself watching this again.

### 🎬 Cleaner

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🧨🏢🔫🧹📞

- **Duration:** 97 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** HBO Max

  **My Thoughts:** I want more from this movie. It feels like the woman version of Jason Statham movies, but it has less action and mid acting. The concept is there, but it falls short in the end.
  
  **IMDB Rating:** 5.2/10

### 🎬 Madea’s Destination Wedding

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🛂🛬💰🦐🏝️

- **Watch Date:** July 12

- **Release Date:** July 11

- **Genre:** Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** PG-13

- **Duration:** 104 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Netflix

- **IMDB Description:** Madea and her family attend Tiffany's rushed destination wedding in the Bahamas. Tensions arise as Tiffany doubts her fiancé Zavier, and her mother acts strangely, raising suspicions about the marriage's legitimacy. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33299083/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_madea%27s%2520des)

  **My Thoughts:** This Madea movie is alright. It has some funny bits and of course the re-occurring cast is funny as always. With that being said I wish it had more. If this is your introduction to the Madea franchise then I don't think this movie would have you desiring more. 

	The resort where they stay is really cool, and I did like that the Madea's brother *(Tyler Perry)* has more of a role. It has the classic comedic one-liners from Madea movies, but the storyline is kind of dumb. It seems really rushed and impractical at the end.

  **Letterboxd Review:** Not my favorite Madea movie, but it was still a pretty solid Madea movie. The first scence with the gas is probably one of the funniest parts of the movie.

  **IMDB Rating:** 5.1/10

  **My Rating:** 3 ⭐

  **Worth the Watch?** ✅
    If you need a good laugh and you don't want to think, you can't go wrong with a Madea movie.


### 🎬 The Wrong Paris 

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🤠🏇👯‍♀️🥐💵

- **Watch Date:** September 20

- **Release Date:** September 12

- **Genre:** Romantic Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** TV-14

- **Duration:** 107 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Netflix

- **IMDB Description:** A woman joins a dating show for an art opportunity, thinking that it's in Paris, France, but it's actually in Paris, Texas. She tries to get eliminated until falling for the bachelor complicates her plans. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33039440/?ref_=ttpl_ov_bk)


  **My Thoughts:** OMG! I want to hate on this movie, but I honestly loved it! I mean come on a hot, shirtless cowboy 🥵 How can one go wrong? Miranda Cosgrove *(Dawn)* and Pierson Fode *(Trey McAllen)* have believable chemistry in the movie. It definitely reminds me of the Bachelor show which is what it was going for.

	The other girls in the competition are great. It features Hannah Stocking *(Eve)* who I remember watching on vine. She does a great job of playing the "dumb" woman character. It also has Madison Pettis *(Lexi Miller)* who I remember from The Game Plan. I swear Miranda Cosgrove and her do not age! 
 
    Is this movie predictable? Yes, but it's a fun watch! I love the saloon and line-dancing scene. The race scene 🐎 is hilarious as well. If you watch the credits, there are some bloopers.
  
   **Letterboxd Review:** Was it cheesy? Yes. Did I love it? Also yes.

### 🎬 Zootopia 2

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🚇🚢📖🪩🦛

- **Watch Date:** November 27

- **Release Date:** November 26

- **Genre:** Family Animation

- **MPA Rating:** PG

- **Duration:** 108 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Theaters (Not on streaming... yet)

- **IMDB Description:** Brave rabbit cop Judy Hopps and her friend, the fox Nick Wilde, team up again to crack a new case, the most perilous and intricate of their careers. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26443597/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_zootopi)

  **My Thoughts:** I love this movie! I honestly think I might like it a little more than the first one. Nibbles Maplestick *(Fortune Feimster)*, the beaver 🦫, make this movie what it is. There is a lot of character growth in Judy Hopps 🐇 *(Ginnifer Goodwin)* and Nick Wilde 🦊 *(Jason Bateman)*.

    This movie explores more of Zootopia including a hidden Reptile world. Ke Huy Quan plays a snake named Gary De'Snake🐍, and I really like his character. Reptiles were exiled from Zootopia long ago, but he gets snuck back in to look for a book. I think the world of Zootopia is really well built, and the animation is phenomenal.

	It has a good twist of a character that is perceived to be good, but they are only pretending to sabotage the heroes. It also has a lot of callback to the original movie featuring a lot of beloved characters. It even some flashbacks from the first movie which help provide context if it has been a while since you've seen the first one. There is also a lot of adult humor snuck in as with a lot of Disney movies. Overall I really did enjoy this movie!

### 🎬 How to Train Your Dragon

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🐦‍🔥⚓📖🛡️🦿

- **Watch Date:** December 1

- **Release Date:** June 13

- **Genre:** Fantasy Adventure

- **MPA Rating:** PG

- **Duration:** 125 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Peacock

- **IMDB Description:** As an ancient threat endangers both Vikings and dragons alike on the isle of Berk, the friendship between Hiccup, an inventive Viking, and Toothless, a Night Fury dragon, becomes the key to both species forging a new future together. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26743210/?ref_=ttpl_ov_bk)

  **My Thoughts:** Wow I did not really have any expectations for this, but I had heard it was really good. It did not disappoint. The actors are great. It does feel like a shot-for-shot of the animated movie, but it does a great job of telling the story. I will note it has been a while since I've seen the animated version.

	I think the actors selected do a great job of portraying the time and the story. Hiccup is my favorite character, and  Mason Thames perfectly portrays him. Toothless and all the dragons 🐉 are really well made, and I understand why this movie got the hype it did.

	*Side note:* The ending song in the credits is amazing. It sounds like another song, but I can't figure out what it is. The score for this movie is really good!

### 🎬 Playdate

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🤖🔫🍕🚗👥

- **Watch Date:** December 2

- **Release Date:** November 12

- **Genre:** Action Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** PG-13

- **Duration:** 94 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Prime Video

- **IMDB Description:** Brian has just been fired from his job. He becomes a stay-at-home dad. He accepts a playdate invitation from another stay-at-home dad who turns out to be a loose cannon. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31425731/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_playdate)


  **My Thoughts:** This movie is dumb. It has some funny lines and scenes, but it is so unbelievable that it kind of becomes unenjoyable. I think that Jeff's *(Alan Ritchson)* character is annoying. He is just so dumb that it's hard to believe he's done some of the stuff he has.

	The twist of him being cloned is a let-down. It is moderately funny, but I kind of just think this movie tries too hard to be funny and modern. I will say that Alan Ritchson and Kevin James *(Brian)* have good chemistry.

  **Letterboxd Review:** The references to other movies were pretty fun. The soundtrack wasn't too shabby. Rhythm of the Night playing every time they drove the minivan through the wall or tried to hit someone was great. The acting and story was mid. Would I watch it again? No. Did I have a good laugh? Yes.

### 🎬 Novocaine

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 💉💰🍳🏹🦴

- **Watch Date:** December 13

- **Release Date:** March 8

- **Genre:** Action Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** R

- **Duration:** 105 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Paramount+ or Prime Video

- **IMDB Description:** When the girl of his dreams is kidnapped, a man incapable of feeling physical pain turns his rare condition into an unexpected advantage in the fight to rescue her. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29603959/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_novoc)

  **My Thoughts:** This movie is super gory and bloody, so I don't recommend eating and watching it (unless you're into that 🤨). Nate *(Jack Quaid)*, the main lead, is fantastic! He is immune to pain, and when the woman he has a crush on gets kidnap he goes after her.

	Bumps, bruises, and broken bones don't stop Nate in his quest to save Sherry *(Amber Midthunder)*, his crush. However we soon learn that Sherry's brother, Simon *(Ray Nicholson)*,  is one of the kidnappers, and Sherry is in on the plan the whole time! I don't think too hard when I watch movies, so I did not see this coming. 

	Nate leans on his only friend, Roscoe *(Jacob Batalon)*, who he has never actually met in person for some guidance through his journey. Roscoe's character is pretty funny, and I like when we actually got to meet him. Nate accidentally kills a few people on his quest, and this movie has the perfect amount of comedy for these scenes and his struggles.
  
  **Letterboxd Review:** I really liked the concept of this & I did not see the twist of Sherry being bad coming. It was very bloody and gory for sure. The breaking of his arm and the ripping off of his fingernails was intense. Thought it was pretty funny though. I liked Roscoe's character. He has some good lines for sure.

### 🎬 Tinsel Town

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🎭🍺🕺🚆🤑

- **Watch Date:** December 25

- **Release Date:** November 28

- **Genre:** Romance Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** TV-14

- **Duration:** 93 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Peacock, Plex, Pluto TV, Roku Channel, Tubi, or Fawesome

- **IMDB Description:** A washed-up Hollywood action hero takes a role in a small English village's quirky Christmas pantomime, where he finds unexpected inspiration through the show's straight-talking dance instructor. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31308201/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_Tinsel%2520town)


  **My Thoughts:** Rebel Wilson *(Jill)* is in the movie. That's it, that's all you need. The concept is good, but I just don't think it's something that needs to be watched. I honestly don't have much to say about it. The character growth is sudden and almost a full 180 which in the span of about 90 minutes feels like whiplash when it really only occurs in less than 30 minutes of the movie.

  **Letterboxd Review:**  Nice Christmas movie. Probably wouldn't watch it again though

### 🎬 Happy Gilmore 2

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 💀🩰🍻💵⛳

- **Watch Date:** December 25

- **Release Date:** July 25

- **Genre:** Sports Comedy

- **MPA Rating:** PG-13

- **Duration:** 117 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Netflix

- **IMDB Description:** To provide for his family, a retired Happy Gilmore must pick up the golf clubs once more and reconnect with the sport he once dominated. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31868189/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_happy)

  **My Thoughts:** This movie was a hoot! It was a great nod to the original Happy Gilmore film, and it was just as unbelievable as the first. Happy Gilmore *(Adam Sandler)* is still not that happy. Within the first few minutes of the film, we find out Happy has won numerous tournaments, has three boys and a girl, and is living his best life. That is until we see him hit a golf ball that kills his wife, Virginia *(Julie Bowen)*, on Mother's Day (but don't worry she is still heavily in the film).

    From there his life is a downward spiral. He drinks heavily, loses the house he spent the entire first film playing for (which belonged to his grandmother), and he hasn't played golf since. It's been many years later, and he's working at a grocery store living with just his daughter. His sons, who seem to share one brain cell amongst them, had to move out and support themselves.

    We also see that after Shooter McGavin *(Christopher McDonald)* went crazy in the first film that he's been in a mental hospital ever since. He still loathes Happy especially because Happy got what he deemed as "his" jacket.

    Happy's daughter Vienna *(Sunny Sandler)* is a talented ballet dancer, and she gets a spot in a very prestigious school which is going to cost a ton of money. *Side Note:* Both of Sandler's daughters: Sunny and Sadie *(Charlotte)* are in the movie as well as his wife Jackie *(Monica)*. Gilmore wants his daughter to have the best experience and opportunities, and he reluctantly picks golf back up. We find out John Daly (yes the golf player as himself) lives in Gilmore's garage. His character is hilarious especially when he starts drinking out of a hand sanitizer bottle.

    One of the main issues with Gilmore is that he feels tremendous guilt for killing his wife, and subsequently he is a heavy drinker which does not bode well for him. As he's trying to get back into the groove, he plays with some random people one of whom is Erin Andre *(Steiner)*. In this scene, Happy drinks so much that he ends up crashing the golf cart. It was a hilarious scene.

    Eventually we find out that Frank *(Benny Safdie)* and Gordie *(Maxwell Jacob Friedman)* want to start a revolutionary new golf league. They want non-boring golf and to challenge the traditional golfers. The top 5 of a tournament get a spot to compete against them.

    Frank is able to get Shooter out of the mental institute because he wants to recruit him. It turns out the players are having surgery to tear a ligament to make their hips rotate more, and therefore hit the ball super far. Happy Gilmore is one of the few who can hit that far too.

    Shooter thinks it is ludicrous, and he runs away eventually running into Gilmore. They tussle, but they decide to be on the same team. Additionally, Gilmore recruits Slim Peterson *(Lavell Crawford)* who plays the son of the late Chubbs Peterson *(Carl Weathers)*. 

    Anyway of course there are a ton more cameos and funny scenes. Gilmore also has a new caddy which is Oscar Meijas *(Bad Bunny)* who is so funny as well. Gilmore's AA leader is none other than Hal L *(Ben Stiller)* who played as the nurse in the nursing home his grandmother went to. His character is just as much as an ass as always. In the end, Happy competes against this new golf league and of course he wins. Oh and Hal gets busted for his AA tactics.

    This movie will have you laughing for sure and reminiscing on the first one. I dare to say it is a hair above the original film. The cameo count is insane (there is an IMDB fun fact about it), and it is a fun game to spot everyone. 

  
  **Letterboxd Review:** It was unbelievably stupid, but it was so great! So many cameos and nods to the first film.

  **IMDB Rating:** 6.1/10

  **My Rating:** 4.5 ⭐

- **Watch Date:** December 29

- **Release Date:** October 31

- **Genre:** Family Animation

- **MPA Rating:** PG

- **Duration:** 99 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Netflix
- **IMDB Description:** A world-renowned K-Pop girl group balance their lives in the spotlight with their secret identities as demon hunters. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14205554/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_kpop)


  **My Thoughts:** Alright, I get the hype of this movie! It's deserved! The songs 🎶 are so catchy, and I definitely had them stuck in my head. Is the movie predictable? I would say somewhat. It has the class miscommunication trope where everything would be solved if people just told the truth, but for a kids movie I think it has a good message.

	The friendship of the HUNTRX is believable, and I like the imagery and animation of the movie. This movie came out at a great time to get a ton of hype, and the songs have even charted. Overall I enjoyed this movie, and I will definitely continue listening to the music! 🎤

  **Letterboxd Review:** Catchy af songs

### 🎬 Karate Kid: Legends

- **Movie in 5 Emojis**: 🍕🥋🚲🪣🔪

- **Watch Date:** December 29

- **Release Date:** May 30

- **Genre:** Action Drama

- **MPA Rating:** PG-13

- **Duration:** 94 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Netflix

- **IMDB Description:** After kung fu prodigy Li Fong relocates to New York City, he attracts unwanted attention from a local karate champion and embarks on a journey to enter the ultimate karate competition with the help of Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1674782/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_karat)

  **My Thoughts:** Jackie Chan is back and as good as ever. This movie is a nice homage to the originals, and it even features Daniel LaRusso *(Ralph Macchio)* and brief cameo of Johnny Lawrence *(William Zabka)*. 

	I enjoy the backstory of Li Fong *(Ben Wang)*. This movie focuses on inner strength and helping one's friends. I do wish the karate 🥋 matches took up a little more of the movie.  Li Fong helps out the girl he likes, Mia Lipani *(Sadie Stanley)*, and her father, Victor Lipani *(Joshua Jackson)*, when they need help. *Side note:* It was nice to see Joshua Jackson in a role where he isn't killing people.

	The end karate scene is good and of course the antagonist always has a low blow, but the protagonist prevails. I did like the antagonist of the story which is Conor Day *(Aramis Knight)*. If you are a fan of The Karate Kid, you'll most likely enjoy this.

- **Watch Date:** December 29

- **Release Date:** August 15

- **Genre:** Action Thriller

- **MPA Rating:** R

- **Duration:** 89 Minutes

- **Where to Watch:** Peacock

- **IMDB Description:** Suburban dad Hutch Mansell, a former lethal assassin, is pulled back into his violent past after thwarting a home invasion, setting off a chain of events. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28996126/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_nobo)

  **My Thoughts:** I honestly did not remember the first movie going into this. There are a few mentions of it, but I honestly think that this could be watched as a stand-alone movie. I think this movie is good, but I don't think it is something that is super memorable.
 
	I do like Hutch Mansell's *(Bob Odenkirk)* character. He's very blunt and too the point. He is also very monotone which isn't always the best. The character of Ledina *(Sharon Stone)* is a lot, but the casino scene is pretty great.

	It has good action and stunts, and the storyline is believable enough. Should they have survived everything that occurs? No, but that's the beauty of the movie industry. 
  
  **Letterboxd Review:** Good amount of action & plot was pretty decent too
