*Let’s explore The King of Sitcoms: Chuck Lorre*

I’m willing to place a hypothetical bet that you’ve seen at least one episode or snippet of a Chuck Lorre sitcom in your life. He is synonymous with sitcoms that have sets that feel realistic and homey. The sitcom homes/apartments in these shows often look like a typical house. 

I want to talk about a few of the sitcoms that he has been a part of, and that I’ve personally seen every episode of. 🤠  

I will note that the main characters descriptions may include depictions of characters at the end of the show as well as throughout the duration of the show.

### 📺 Young Sheldon  
**Created By:** Chuck Lorre & Steven Molaro  
**Show Description:** It's 1989, and 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper has skipped four grades to start high school along with his less-intellectual older brother. As he struggles to be understood by his family, classmates, and neighbors, his mother arms him with the best tool she has: reminding bullies that his dad is the football coach and his brother is on the team. His twin sister doesn't share his exceptional mind, but she is brilliant at reading people and has a much clearer vision of what life has in store for the young genius. Jim Parsons, who plays the adult version of Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory (2007), narrates. [See full IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6226232/?ref_=fn_t_1)     
**Number of Seasons:** 7  
**Number of Episodes:** 141  
**Total Duration:** 2,809 Minutes or 46.8 hours or ~1.95 Days   
**Aired:** 2017-2024  
**IMDB Score:** 7.7/10  
**Spin-off:** Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage  
**The Main Characters:**
- Sheldon Cooper *(Iain Armitage)*
  - Starts high school at 9
  - Quirky, lacks social skills, and has difficulties understanding irony and sarcasm in others
- Mary Cooper *(Zoe Perry)*
  - Sheldon’s mom
  - Very religious
- George Cooper Sr. *(Lance Barber)*
  - Sheldon’s dad
  - Football coach at his school
- Connie ‘Meemaw’ Tucker *(Annie Potts)*
  - Mary’s mother & Sheldon’s closest confidant 
  - Independent, free-spirited, & fun

  - Opposite of Sheldon
- Georgie Cooper *(Montana Jordan)*

- Dr. John Sturgis *(Wallace Shawn)*
  - Sheldon’s mentor
  - Love interest to Meemaw   

**Why I Enjoyed It:** I really enjoy learning the backstory of Sheldon Cooper and seeing his family dynamic. He’s quirky and blunt, and I think Iain was the perfect actor. As the seasons progress, you literally watch the characters grow up, especially the younger ones. I think it does a great job of continuing the Big Bang Theory franchise and providing more insight into why Sheldon is the way that he is.    

**👀 Where to Watch:** HBO Max or Netflix

It is also supposed to be set in Knoxville, TN even though it is very clearly not. It has been renewed for season 2, so I am eager to see it when it comes out!
