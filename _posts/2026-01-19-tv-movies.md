*I swear I've never seen this before, I'll just watch my favorite scene, and other silly lines that I use when I know I am going to watch the whole movie*

We've all been there channel surfing 🌊 and looking for something to watch. Here are the movies that everytime they are on, I am drawn to watch them. They have me in a chokehold every watch, and I am always wondering what is going to happen. Obviously I have seen them before, but I like to pretend that I don't know what is going to happen.

So let's dive into the 5 movies I will always watch when they are on in no particular order! 🤿

    - **IMDB Rating:** 7.1/10
    - **My Rating:** 5 ⭐
    - **LetterBox'd Review:** Oh Beni. I love this movie so much. It never gets old no matter how much I watch it.

       Think about my kids!  
       You don't have kids Beni.  
       Well, not yet.  

    - **Why I Rewatch:** It's a classic, and I love it. It has everything you could want: action, adventure, romance, horror, and comedy. I love all the characters in it, and it's a long enough movie that you can put it on in the background and still get a lot done.  

     My last rewatch for this film was *January 18, 2026.* Yes, this was in fact one day before this article was released, and it helped inspire me to do this post.

2. ### 🎬 The Equalizer
    - **Movie in 5 Emojis:** 📚🪵🎲🏥🔨
    - **Release Year:** 2014
    - **Genre:** Action Thriller
    - **MPA Rating:** R
    - **Duration:** 132 Minutes
    - **IMDB Description:** A man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him cannot stand idly by when he meets a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455944/?ref_=fn_t_1)
    - **IMDB Rating:** 7.3/10
    - **My Rating:** 4.5 ⭐
    - **LetterBox'd Review:** The song, Vengeance, that plays at the beginning of the final standoff really sets the mood. That whole final scene has got to be one of my favorites.
    - **Why I Rewatch:** One of my favorite types of plotlines are  revenge plotlines. Denzel Washington's performance in this movie is phenomenal. I really love this franchise. There is enough action to keep you engaged, but it also has that mysterious air of learning more about the characters. The action in the film is really well done, and the entire final scene at the hardware store is so good.  

    My last rewatch for this film was *November 9, 2025.* Fun fact, this same day I also rewatched *Men in Black* which is another great movie to watch when it comes on TV.

3. ### 🎬 Matilda
    - **Movie in 5 Emojis:** 🚗📚🍯🏋️‍♀️🍫
    - **Release Year:** 1996
    - **Genre:** Family Comedy
    - **MPA Rating:** PG
    - **Duration:** 98 Minutes
    - **IMDB Description:** A girl gifted with a keen intellect and psychic powers uses both to get even with her callous family and free her kindly schoolteacher from the tyrannical grip of a sadistic headmistress. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117008/?ref_=fn_t_1)
    - **IMDB Rating:** 7.0/10
    - **My Rating:** N/A
    - **Why I Rewatch:** This film does not have a rating simply because it has been a long time since I have seen this film. I remember this movie used to come on TV *all the time*, and I think there was a point where I may have watched it multiple times in the same week. 🙈 Danny DeVito is hilarious in this film albeit he is playing a liar and horrible father. The pigtail scene will live in my memory forever.

4. ### 🎬 Holes
    - **Movie in 5 Emojis:** 👟🕳️🦎💰🧅
    - **Release Year:** 2003
    - **Genre:** Comedy Drama
    - **MPA Rating:** PG
    - **Duration:** 117 Minutes
    - **IMDB Description:** A wrongfully convicted boy is sent to a brutal desert detention camp where he joins the job of digging holes for some mysterious reason. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311289/?ref_=fn_t_1)
    - **IMDB Rating:** 7.0/10
    - **My Rating:** N/A
    - **Why I Rewatch:** This film does not have a rating simply because it has been a long time since I have seen this film. This was another film that used to come on TV *all the time.* I think I saw this movie so much that at one point I could probably quote a majority of the movie (I still can quote the main parts 😉). It has the adventure aspect when Stanley and Zero leave the camp. It also has the Western feel as we learn more about Kissin' Kate and the curse that is on the Yelnats family. Shia LaBeouf in his earlier days. The humor, the curse, the whole film is wonderful.  

    You'll never catch me saying *I'm tired of this [movie], grandpa*.

5. ### 🎬 Any Adam Sandler Movie
  Here are my top **3**!  

 - 🎥 **Blended**  

    - **Movie in 5 Emojis:** 🍲👗🌍💇‍♀️💖
    - **Release Year:** 2014
    - **Genre:** Romance Comedy
    - **MPA Rating:** PG-13
    - **Duration:** 117 Minutes
    - **IMDB Description:** After a bad blind date, a man and woman find themselves stuck together at a resort for families, where their attraction grows as their respective kids benefit from the burgeoning relationship. [See Full IMDB Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086772/?ref_=fn_t_1)
    - **IMDB Rating:** 6.5/10
    - **My Rating:** 4 ⭐
    - **Why I Rewatch:** We are blending into one family.🎶 Terry Crews appearing everywhere really brings the movie together. Well that and every mispronunciation of Adam Sandler's characters fake last name. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are back in this film, and they are as always phenomenal and hilarious together. Adam Sandler's youngest daughter in the film is so funny. The movie is ridiculous, but it is always a fun watch when it comes on. My last rewatch of this film was *March 18, 2024* although I may have seen a scene or two last year.  

 - 🎥 **Pixels**
    - **Movie in 5 Emojis:** 👾📡📺🛸🦧

    - **IMDB Rating:** 5.6/10
    - **My Rating:** 4 ⭐
    - **LetterBox'd Review:** "You should sell that at Barnes and Unstable"
      The dialogue is funny, it's a good ode to 80s video games, and it's a fun watch!
    - **Why I Rewatch:** I just love the entire concept of the movie! It has some hilarious one liners. It does a good job of bringing the video games to life. Kevin James being president is just so ridiculous. Josh Gad's character is probably one of my favorites in this film. I most recently rewatched part of this last month, but I did not log it.   

 - 🎥 **50 First Dates**
    - **Movie in 5 Emojis:** 🦭🖌️🚗🎶⛵

    - **IMDB Rating:** 6.8/10
    - **My Rating:** 4 ⭐
    - **Why I Rewatch:** I haven't seen this film in a while, but it's another classic Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler film. It has a great blend of comedy and romance. The seal is amazing 🦭, and Rob Schneider's character is probably one of my favorites in this movie. 🥥 It's a great shorter film to watch on TV when you need you're in need a romance comedy.
