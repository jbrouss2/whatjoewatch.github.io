*Love them or hate them: Let's talk about 2️⃣8️⃣ RomComs that I recommend!*   

**What is a RomCom?**     
RomCom is short for Romantic Comedy. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy#:~:text=Romantic%20comedy%20%28commonly%20shortened%20to,able%20to%20surmount%20all%20obstacles.), "[it is] a sub-genre of comedy and romance fiction, focusing on lighthearted, humorous plot lines centered on romantic ideas, such as how love is able to surmount all obstacles." It is derived from "Ancient Greek comedy, medieval romance, and 18th-century Restoration comedy." A key part of a romcom is the "meet-cute" which is a funny or unexpected initial meeting, i.e., running into someone that sets up the initial tension and eventually leads to the romantic storyline.   

I love a good RomCom, so here are 2️⃣8️⃣ that I personally recommend! I have them separated into two sections: classic 💖 and teen 💗. Each RomCom will have a few sentences about why you should watch the movie. It may also have some notable quotes or even a question for you to ponder.      

If I haven't seen the RomCom in a while, I did not include a rating as I felt it would not be accurate. I found where to stream on IMDB, but these may be inaccurate.   

These are all my opinions, and I understand not every movie is for everyone. 🫶   

Now, let's fall in love... with fictional men and women💗🍿
