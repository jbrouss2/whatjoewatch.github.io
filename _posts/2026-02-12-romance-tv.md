*Whether you are looking for feel-good, drama, toxic relationships, or even killer romances, there is a show for you!*

Are you looking for the perfect romance show to watch this month? Here is a list of some fictional and nonfictional romance shows! This is by no means a comprehensive list, but these are some of my favorites! 💕      

------
# Fictional Shows   
## Ones I've Seen    
### 💞 Sweet Magnolias      
**Genres:** Feel-good Romance, Drama     
**Show Description:** Three South Carolina women, best friends since high school, shepherd one another through the complexities of romance, career, and family. [See full IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9077540/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_sweet%2520ma)     
**Number of Seasons:** 4 (5 is coming June 11)          
**Number of Episodes:** 40        
**Total Duration:** 1998 Minutes or 33.3 Hours or a little over 1 day           
**Aired:** 2020-       
**MPA Rating:** TV-14               
**IMDB Score:** 7.3/10          
**Why It's Worth the Watch:** I absolutely love this show! I think the first 3 seasons are really good, and I have actually watched those seasons a couple times! The fourth one was good, but I did find it lacking some. This show brings friendship and romance. Each woman has their own story! The premise of the first season is about Maddie, a mom of 3, who recently found out her husband cheated on her and got another woman pregnant. 🤰 It's about her navigating her life with her friends by her side to support her. Dana Sue and Helen have their own drama as well. Dana Sue's husband who she is separated from is pining for her love. Helen is navigating her life, and her desire to want children. 👶 The ladies also open up a spa! 💆‍♀️ The show takes place in a fictional southern town, but I believe it is filmed in Charleston, SC. It is based on books by Sheryl Wood, but there has been some enhancements for TV.              

This is a perfect watch for you and your girl friend or even solo! It has drama, cute clothes (I want so many of Maddie's outfits), adult romance, teen romance, friendship, and margaritas! 🍋‍🟩   

**👀 Where to Watch:** Netflix        

### 💌 My Life with the Walter Boys 
**Genres:** Coming-of-Age, Teen Drama  
**Show Description:** Jackie Howard's life is disrupted by a freak accident, she is ripped from her home and has to start over on a ranch in Colorado, with her guardian and a family of nine boys and one girl. [See full IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8323628/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_my%2520life)    
**Number of Seasons:** 2        
**Number of Episodes:** 20           
**Total Duration:** 900 Minutes or 15 Hours         
**Aired:** 2023-      
**MPA Rating:** TV-14              
**IMDB Score:** 6.8/10          
**Why It's Worth the Watch:** This is another based on a book show! The first season had me hooked, but I will admit that I have *not* watched the second season yet. This is partly due to Netflix waiting so long (not as long as Stranger Things) in between seasons. Two of the brothers have a crush on Jackie because of course. They live on a ranch so you get a little cowboy action. 🤠       

This is another girl's night watch or watch with an older teen!     

**👀 Where to Watch:** Netflix

**IMDB Score:** 5.7/10         
**Why It's Worth the Watch:** I loveeeee a good competition reality show especially this one. It's so nostalgic for me. I swear every Saturday morning this show was on. I am conviced I've only seen the same handful of episodes. It also is fun to see the budgets, and how everything has gotten so expensive. Also some of them have some ~interesting~ themes.    

**Bonus**: There is a cretor on Instagram that did a where are they now series for some of the couples! 

**👀 Where to Watch:** HBO Max, Disney + (Seasons 1-2, 9-10), Hulu (Seasons 1-2, 9-10)

**Aired:** 2007-    
**MPA Rating:** TV-PG             
**IMDB Score:** 5.7/10

**Bonus**: There are multiple spinoffs! These are two ones that stick out to me! *Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta* which aired from 2010-2020. It also features Lori and Monte as the stylists, and they bring southern sass and charm to the show. *Say Yes to the Dress: Bridesmaids* which aired from 2011-2013.

## Is this real love?     
### 💗 Married at First Sight 💍

**IMDB Score:** 6.2/10          
**Why It's Worth the Watch:** There is always so much drama, and it also it is kind of a social experiment to see if compatibility first is key. There are matchmakers that match people together, but I don't think there are a lot of matches. It is cool to see, and each season is in a new city. 🏢

**IMDB Score:** 4.7/10      
**Why It's Worth the Watch:** It has been a few years since I have seen this show, but I did actually enjoy it! I thought it was an interesting take on blind dating. The artistry of the costumes is really neat.           

**👀 Where to Watch:**  Netflix

**MPA Rating:** TV-14

**Why It's Worth the Watch:** Drama, drama, drama. Is some of it scripted? 100% Is it trash TV? 100% I do actually enjoy some of the couples throughout the season, and some of them do last! However, there are so many that are toxic from the start, and it makes you greatful that you aren't in one (I hope).

### 💚 Catfish: The TV Show
**Show Description:** Nev Schulman and Max Joseph help people who have fallen in love online test the authenticity of their lovers' identities. [See full IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2498968/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_6_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_catfish)    
**Number of Seasons:** 9        
**Number of Episodes:** 274 (according to IMDB)        
**Episodes Need to Be Watched in Order:** ❌     
**Average Episode Duration:** 42 Minutes       
**Aired:** 2012-2025     
**MPA Rating:** TV-14             
**IMDB Score:** 7.1/10           
**Why It's Worth the Watch:** It gave us soooooo many good clips. We have the chick who was on there multiple times, Jose who was on their multiple times, the one where it was the girl's girlfriend who SHE LIVED WITH, and that one where Nev almost gets in a fight while he is on crutches. I have an episode clip saved where a girl says that the guy lost some "keys" and Kami (the host in later seasons) goes "Keys? of Cocaine? Girl if he lost those then he's not responding because he's dead." 💀 There was also a guy who belived he was talking to Katy Perry... he was not ✨. There was also one, or a few, where they set the whole thing up to be on TV! With that being said, we did get some real romances out of it, and I think some of the folks may still be together. It does make you wonder who's really on the other side of the screen. 💻
